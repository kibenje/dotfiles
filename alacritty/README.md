Alacritty - A cross platform, GPU accelerated terminal emulator

Alaciritty is so far the fastest terminal emulator in existence. Using the GPU for rendering enables optimizations that simply are not possible with a regular terminal. Not to mention the speed and performance increase when navigating the terminal and using other configurations such as Vim and tmux.
